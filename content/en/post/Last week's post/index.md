## Study üìö

1. Last week I learned a lot of new things: when doing laboratory work No. 5 on operating systems, I learned how to change access rights for files, it turns out it's so simple and interesting!
2. In the fourth year I had 2 very interesting lectures: on mathematical analysis and on anlnitic geometry, I especially liked geometry) When the subject of anlnitic geometry started at our university, I realized that geometry is cool and sooo interesting!
3. On Friday, we had a concert dedicated to the 8th of March at the translator's model, and after that we went to couples, there we analyzed the retelling of the text on the topic "What will our future be like"
